# Baby Monitor - Server

The server for my baby monitor. It utilizes [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/), [Grove SHT31 Temperature Humidity Sensor](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_SHT31_Temp_Humi_Sensor), a simple USB microphone with some python code to provide a video and audio stream with an sensor API to check on your newborn.

## Instructions

### Raspberry Pi

If you start with a fresh Raspberry Pi installation have a look at the [raspberry pi setup](./raspberry-pi-setup.sh) script. It might be useful for you, but is a bit outdated since I moved from a node API to a python project.

### API
